Plan Your Fundraising Event 
We have made numerous fundraising events for our cause! Now you can help us make events too! Start by creating a plan for your event. This includes thinking about the theme, the logistics of the event and what your goals are. As the saying goes, “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”

Share Your Plans With Us
We would love to know what you’re working on! Share your plans with us throughout the process. This is a partnership (a great one!) and communication will be key. As members of Solar Chapter, we are also here as a resource to help you carry out your event. Don’t forget to share with us important information such as date, time and place so that we can also help you promote your event. Fill all of these out in the GOOGLE FORM HERE. Our member will shortly contact you after!

Solar Chapter Wishes you the Best for your event 
Congratulations! It’s now time for the most exciting part of your event; running it! All the planning and setting up has lead you to this step and we believe in you! Fundraising is a unique and gratifying experience, so make sure you get the most of it by being prepared, committing to your goals, and most importantly, having FUN! 

Let us know how it goes
Our officers will be contacting you soon after your fundraising event to sort some financial and logistical aspects. Aside from that, we would love to hear how you felt about the event and get some feedback! 

See the impact you’ve made! 
Your journey with Solar Chapter does not end here! We would like to thank you again for your contribution to our mission. A big part of why we do what we do is because we can see the extensive positive impacts of our projects. We would like to share that feeling with you and how you have impacted the community!
